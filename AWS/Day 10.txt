1. IAM
2. RDS

=> What is IAM?
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management

=> Login types into the AWS Console;
	1. Username and Password - Email and Password				- Root User (All kinds of permissions) 
	2. Username and Password - IAM Username and IAM Password	- IAM User (Restrictions - Root user will provide restrictions)

=> IAM is a global service
=> IAM is FREE for lifelong

=> Identity = Authentication
	- To provide authentication to AWS account, identity is important
=> To get access to AWS services, an user has to create AWS account using email and password
=> AWS suggests to use only IAM User account to avoid any security breaches

=> IAM Concepts
	- IAM Users
	- IAM Roles
	- IAM Policies
	- IAM Groups

=> Project --- Dev, Test, Ops, DB Teams.... --- AWS Console Access

=> IAM Users
	- IAM User is the one which is created by Root User as per the required permissions
	- IAM User can have the direct access to AWS Console or Root user can give Programmatic Access/CLI as well

=> IAM Roles
	- If you want to give temporary access, then we will choose IAM Roles
	- Access Keys and Secret Access Keys - IAM User
	- We need to attach policies

=> IAM Policies
	- Types of policies;
		-- AWS Managed Policies
