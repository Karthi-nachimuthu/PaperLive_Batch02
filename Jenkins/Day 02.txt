Step 1: Launch Amazon Linux 2 AMI, t2.micro
sudo -s   
sudo yum update

Step 2: Install Git, Java 17 and Maven in server
yum install git java-17-amazon-corretto maven -y
  
Step 3: Jenkins installation
Official documentation for commands 
(Jenkins.io ---> download ---> RedHat) show in browser Jenkins.io ---> LTS Redhat (URL: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#red-hat-centos)

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

sudo yum upgrade

yum install jenkins -y

systemctl start jenkins.service

systemctl status jenkins.service  
You should see "active (running)" in green colour 

NOTE: chkconfig jenkins on
The above command will make Jenkins service automatically restart itself whenever a server is stopped and restarted


9. Freestyle Project - Build Triggers - Build Periodically
We will use cron syntax to schedule the job

* * * * * ----> Every minute the job will get executed
H/2 * * * *  ----> Every 30 minutes the job will get executed
H * * * * ----> Every 60 minutes the job will get executed

Build Periodically, the job gets executed automatically at the scheduled time.
Build Periodically option will not bother about the changes in the code available in GitHub repo. It will keep on executing the job based on the cron syntax.

The main problem with this option is, the storage capacity of the instance will be utilized unwantedly

10. Freestyle Project - Build Triggers - POLL SCM
We will use cron syntax to schedule the job
* * * * *

Poll SCM will look after the changes made in the GitHub repo, and if there is a change in the code, the job will be built automatically

The main problem with this option is, we need to wait for 1 minute minimum

11. Freestyle Project - Build Triggers - GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
In real-time, we will prefer to work with GitHub Web Hooks

12. Freestyle Project - Build Triggers - Build After Other Projects are Built (Upstream and Downstream Jobs)

Job 1 ---- Manually Click Build Now ---- Success
Job 2 ---- Trigger this job, if the Job 1 is successfully built
Job 3 ---- Trigger this job, if the Job 2 is successfully built

The execution of one job is dependent on the successful execution of previous job

13. Freestyle Project - Build Triggers - Trigger job remotely
JENKINS_URL/job/job01/build?token=TOKEN_NAME


http://44.207.4.168:8080/job/job01/build?token=123456
123456

14. Freestyle Project - Automation of Build and Deployment Process


15. Freestyle Project - Storing the Artifact
S3 Bucket


If Jenkins wants to communicate with the AWS Cloud, we will create IAM User and we will generate the access key and secret access key.
Attach Administrator Access to the IAM User

Install "S3 Publisher" plugin" --- Jenkins will go and communicate with S3 Bucket
S3 Bucket --- 1st time --- 1st war
		  --- 2nd time --- 2nd war

15. Freestyle Project - Restoring the Job
Install "Job Configuration History"

Note:  Whatevver the jobs that were created after installing the plugin, only those jobs can be recovered


Thin Backup plugin
